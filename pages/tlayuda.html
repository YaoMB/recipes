        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The tlayuda, is a handmade dish in traditional Oaxacan cuisine, consisting of a large, thin, crunchy, partially fried or toasted tortilla covered with a spread of refried beans, asiento (unrefined pork lard), lettuce or cabbage, avocado, meat (usually shredded chicken, beef tenderloin or pork), Oaxaca cheese and salsa.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Thin beef steak</li>
            <li>Black beans</li>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Radish</li>
            <li>Cilantro</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Oaxacan cheese</li>
            <li>Lime</li>
            <li>Chile arbol</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Avocado leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We make a simple marinade to help flavour and tenderise the beef so that it's the juiciest it can be. A couple of hours at the least, but overnight is even better.</li>
            <li>Because we're using canned beans, the cooking time is a fraction of what it would be otherwise. We start by toasting the chiles and avocado leaves (you can also use bay leaf) and then blend them with the beans into a puree.</li>
            <li>Fry the puree with onion for 30 minutes until it's thick, creamy and ready.</li>
            <li>I use store-bought corn tortillas which crisp up in the oven in a matter of minutes. You can crisp them up on the BBQ grill too, just be careful not to burn them.</li>
            <li>Simply chop your salad ingredients and dress with a little lime juice. This will be your garnish.</li>
            <li>Quesillo (Oaxacan cheese) is like mozzarella and can be pulled apart into strands. Do this just before serving and set aside.</li>
            <li>Start by spreading the beans as a base then follow with the meat, salad and cheese. A final spritz of lime juice finishes your tlayuda. Repeat until you're out of ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
